This folder contains all of the labs completed as part of the IBM Machine Learning Professional Certificate Capstone. The goal of this project was to build a course recommendation system for an online educational platform. Several different approaches were implemented: content-based and collaborative filtering, memory-based and model-based, and both traditional machine learning and deep learning techniques.

I would particularly like to highlight labs 2, 3, and 5, in which I applied natural language processing techniques -- bag of words analysis, tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, embedding, and cosine similarity -- to measure the similarity between courses based on their titles and descriptions.

In labs 7 and 8 I took a collaborative filtering approach, analyzing the user-item interaction matrix with k-nearest neighbors (lab 7) and non-negative matrix factorization (lab 8).

In lab 9, I developed a neural network recommendation system trained on previous user course ratings, preferred user genres, and course generes.
