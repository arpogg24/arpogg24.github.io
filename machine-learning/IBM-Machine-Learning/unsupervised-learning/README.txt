The notes folder contains detailed notes on unsupervised learning and dimensionality reduction techniques. Some of them were covered in the IBM Machine Learning Professional Certification course on unsupervised learning. Others were not covered in the course but were discussed in The Elements of Statistical Learning (Friedman, Tibshirani, Hastie). This is an excellent reference for traditional machine learning techniques and statistical learning theory generally, and I followed it in great detail while completing the certification.

The project_notebook folder contains an analysis of real-world country development data. My goal was to use a combination of dimensionality reduction, clustering techniques, and choropleth mapping to see if there was any geographical clustering implicit in the development data. Indeed, I was able to identify clear geographic patters using k-means and hierarchical agglomerative clustering. Interestingly, these patters disappeared when density-based methods like DBSCAN were used.
