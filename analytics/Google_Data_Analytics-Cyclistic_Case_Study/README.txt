This folder contains an R markdown (Rmd) file detailing a data analytics case study I completed as part of the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate program. It also contains an html and pdf file rendered from that Rmd file. In addition to functioning as a capstone for my data analytics certification, this project was also an opportunity for me to learn the basics of R. Past programming experience has been in python (my preferred language), MATLAB, C++, and Java.

This project is largely incomplete. In a marketing or BI context, this document would serve only as an internal document for a data analytics / science team. The main deliverables would be in the form of production graphics and a report and/or presentation that focuses only on the main conclusions of the analysis without excessive technical detail. It was my intention to produce such graphics and reports, but in the interest of time I had to move on after finishing the technical analysis.
